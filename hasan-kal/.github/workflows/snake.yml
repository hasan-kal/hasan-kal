# Contribution Snake

This project generates a contribution snake SVG based on the user's GitHub contributions. The snake is automatically generated daily at midnight UTC through a GitHub Actions workflow.

## How It Works

The workflow defined in `.github/workflows/snake.yml` uses the Platane/snk action to create a visual representation of your contributions in the form of a snake. The generated SVG file is then pushed to the `output` branch of the repository.

## Manual Trigger

You can also manually trigger the workflow from the GitHub Actions tab in your repository.
